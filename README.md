The intention is to write a python code to extract the EPARs (=European Public Assessment Reports) contained at the European Medicines website (https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/ema_group_types/ema_medicine/field_ema_web_categories%253Aname_field/Human').

At the same time I train on webscraping techniques enjoying myself.

Some parts are commented, i.e. on hold, until I manage to fix an error I am encountering: TypeError: find() missing 1 required positional argument: 'self'. 

Any sugesstions on how to fix the error are welcome.
